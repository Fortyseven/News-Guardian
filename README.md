# News Guardian

This is a new fork of Gag Reflex. I gave up on updating Gag Reflex, but considering the state of the world right now, a tool like this is needed more than ever. However, I no longer have the time to invest in fixing bugs and providing support, so I have stripped it down to just the bare functionality. 

If you do not agree my domain selections, feel free to fork your own. Just give it a new name.

What's currently going on:

* All customization options have been removed.
* Temporarily removed Reddit support.
* Temporarily removed per-website warnings.
* No longer differentiates between satire/questionable content. **Satire, biased, and fraudulent news sites are all treated the same**, simply highlighted as a reminder to check the source.
* Gag Reflex was removed from the Chrome app store months ago.
* Gag Reflex is now known as 'News Guardian'.
* Chrome is still the primary target, but ports to Firefox, Edge, and possibly Safari will be examined.
