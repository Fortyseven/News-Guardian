## About 
This is a new fork of <a href="https://github.com/Fortyseven/GagReflex">Gag Reflex</a>. I gave up on updating Gag Reflex, but considering the state of the world right now, a tool like this is needed more than ever. However, I no longer have the time to invest in fixing bugs and providing support, so I have stripped it down to just the bare functionality. 

Here's the [current list](https://github.com/Fortyseven/News-Guardian/blob/master/src/ng_config.js) of sites covered.

If you do not agree my domain selections, feel free to fork your own. Just give it a new name. *However*, I would strongly encourage you to add suggestions for new entries and revisions via <a href="https://github.com/Fortyseven/News-Guardian/issues">GitHub issue tickets</a> first, before going that route.

Differences between Gag Reflex and News Guardian:

* All customization options have been removed.
* Temporarily removed Reddit support.
* Temporarily removed per-website warnings.
* No longer differentiates between satire/questionable content. **Satire, biased, and fraudulent news sites are all treated the same**, simply highlighted as a reminder to check the source.
* Gag Reflex was removed from the Chrome app store months ago.
* Gag Reflex is now known as 'News Guardian'.
* Chrome is still the primary target, but ports to Firefox, Edge, and possibly Safari will be examined.
